## Introduction

This project focuses on recognizing digits in hand signs to assist hearing-impaired individuals in daily communication. It serves as a foundation for more complex research and applications, such as translating sign language into sentences or paragraphs.

## Problem Statement

- **Input**: Images containing hand signs representing digits (0-9).  
- **Output**: Predicted label corresponding to the hand sign digit.  
- **Constraints**: Each input image contains only one hand captured at an optimal distance to maintain image quality.  

## Feature Extraction

The project utilizes the following feature extraction methods:

- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**: Extracts local features based on pixel gradient orientations.  
- **Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)**: Detects and describes scale-invariant features.  
- **Bag of Visual Words (BoVW)**: Constructs feature representations based on visual word dictionaries.  

## Classification Models

We experimented with three machine learning models for classification:

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds an optimal boundary between classes.  
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies based on the k-nearest neighbors.  
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning model based on multiple decision trees.  

## Experiments

### Dataset

- **Dataset Used**: Sign Language Digits Dataset  
- **Image Size**: 100 x 100 pixels  
- **Color Space**: RGB  
- **Number of Classes**: 10 (Digits 0-9)  
- **Collected From**: 218 students, each contributing 10 samples.  

### Model Evaluation

5-fold Cross-Validation was used to assess model accuracy.

#### Test Set Performance:

- **HOG + SVM**: Best with `C=100`, `gamma=0.01`, `kernel='rbf'`.  
- **HOG + KNN**: Best with `k=23`.  
- **HOG + Random Forest**: Best with `n=140`.  
- **BoVW + SVM**: Best with `C=1`, `gamma=0.01`, `kernel='rbf'`.  
- **BoVW + KNN**: Best with `k=27`.  
- **BoVW + Random Forest**: Best with `n=120`.
